## Full Stack Web Developer

Hi, my name is Akif Sahin Korkmaz. 

I am a software developer. Interested in full stack web development with experience using React, Svelte, ExpressJs, Django, DRF and Flask. 
Also fascinated by computer vision and efficient searching algorithms. I am passionate about programming. I have strong and steady incentives to always achive better and always do my best because I love what I do, whether it is a nice looking website with an enriched user experience, a solid backend or any type of application. 

My interest in programming started in high-school and, I have been dealing with this field to make it a profession since 2020. During this two years, I have employed my programming skills in both personal and team projects. I can adapt quickly and work well with professionals from other disciplines. I belive learning is a lifelong process which should never stop. Therefore, I am more than eager to learn new technologies and new skills in every chance i will get.
